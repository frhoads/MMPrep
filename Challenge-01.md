Part 1
======
Watch “Foundations of Programming: Fundamentals” at Lynda.com and then answer
the following questions:

1. Imagine asking a friend to meet you at a restaurant. What instructions would 
   a computer program need that your friend would not in order to understand how
   to get there?
   
**ANSWER HERE**
For a computer program, you would have to give it specific turn by turn directions, including speed and other information about the road.

2. What is the difference between source code and machine code? What does the
   CPU do? Where are instructions and data stored?
   
**ANSWER HERE**
Source code is written (and read) by the programmer, while machine code is read by the CPU. Source code is written in a more understandable “human language” so it is easier to read and write than machine code.  

The CPU executes the machine code to run the program.

The data is stored in an executable file and run in system memory.

3. What is an IDE and why is it useful?

**ANSWER HERE**

An IDE is an Integrated Development Environment, like Apple’s Xcode. These are useful because they provide many tools for writing a particular language for professional development.

4. What kind of a language is Objective-C? Why do you think we use it for making
   device specific applications? Why wouldn't we want to use an interpreted
   language for making iPhone and iPad apps?
   
**ANSWER HERE**

Objective-C is a compiled language. 

We use Objective-C because this is Apple’s chosen language for iOS development and Apple provides an IDE for us to that end. 

Compiled languages run faster than interpreted languages, which is useful given the limited resources that a mobile device has. Since we are targeting iOS devices it makes sense to write programs specifically for them.
